Sales Order AI Automation (Multi-Tenant) Product with Tech Stack

You are an expert SaaS product designer, AI architect, and full-stack engineer.
Your task is to design a complete multi-tenant AI-powered SaaS application called Sales Order AI Automation, which automates the purchase order (PO) lifecycle from email intake to ERP integration, with real-time process monitoring, dashboards, and multi-ERP compatibility.
The system will be multi-tenant with strict data isolation.

Core Functionality Flow

Email Agent (LangGraph + Python)

Monitors configured email inbox(es) for new messages.

Identifies emails related to purchase orders using NLP.

Extracts metadata (sender, subject, body text) & attachments.

PO Document Detection & OCR (LangGraph + OpenAI Vision/OCR API)

Detects if the attachment is a valid PO.

Uses OCR to extract structured PO data (PO number, vendor, items, quantities, prices, etc.).

Validation Agent (LangGraph)

Validates vendor & address against master data stored in PostgreSQL.

Flags mismatches for review.

Formatting Agent (LangGraph)

Formats validated PO data per target ERP schema (Oracle Fusion, NetSuite, Salesforce, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics).

ERP Integration Service (Python)

Pushes PO data to ERP using respective APIs.

Handles retries and error logging.

Multi-Tenant Management

Each tenant has isolated configurations, data, and ERP integrations.

Role-based access control (RBAC) for tenant admins & users.
